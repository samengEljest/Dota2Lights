# Dota2Lights
An application built in C# to connect Philips Hue lights to the game Dota 2.


To run the program unpack Dota2Lights.zip. Double click on DotaLightApp.exe.
The first time the application starts you will need to press the button on your Philips Bridge to register the application.
The lights should start the first time you get a new gamestate update in the game, eather when the timer is at 0 or the first time you take damage.

If you want to continue the development the source code can be found in DotaLightsApp folder.
You will need to include two other GitHub projects for the project to start, Q42.HueApi and Dota2GSI.
